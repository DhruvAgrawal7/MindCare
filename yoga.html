    <h2>4. Chakrasana (Wheel pose)    </h2>
    <p>Chakrasana or Urdhva Dhanurasana — also called as Full-Wheel Pose and Upward Bow Pose, is a back-bending posture that opens up the chest, tones the thighs, abdomen, and arms, and engages the whole body. As a heart-opening stretch, this pose helps release sadness and depression. It gets its name from the Sanskrit words, chakra, meaning wheel, and asana, meaning posture.
    </p> <br>
    <p>It is known as Chakrasana because when you perform this asana, your body practically assumes a semi-circular posture. Chakrasana, also known as Urdhva Dhanurasana, is a familiar yoga pose that many perform to strengthen and stretch their spines. The "Wheel Pose," or as most folks like to call it, the Upward Facing Bow Pose, is a vital part of Ashtanga Yoga, a kind of yoga that, among other different advantages, improves heart health, relieves stress, burns fat, and serves as a cardio workout. Sri K. Pattabhi Jois first popularised this kind of yoga in 1975. It calls for rapid, continuous Ashtanga position repetition.‍It is said that the Chakrasana posture aligns the seven chakras of your body by strengthening your physical and mental health, including the Muladhara (the Root Chakra), situated at the base of your spine; the Svadhisthana (the Sacral Chakra), Manipura (the Navel Chakra), Anahata (the Heart Chakra), Vishuddha (the Throat Chakra), Ajna (the Third Eye Chakra), and Sahasrara (the Crown Chakra).</p>

    </ol>

    <p>Savasana is commonly known as the corpse pose. It is a relaxing position practiced at the end of the yoga session where the body is kept still in a supine position (lying on the back facing upwards).

    </p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Benefits of Savasana in Managing Diabetes: Savasana or corpse pose may have a potential benefit in managing diabetes. Savasana practice over a period of time can help in decreasing stress, an important pathological aspect of developing diabetes. Stress activates the oxidation process at the lipid membrane level and helps in releasing oxygen from the tissue creating a situation known as hypoxia. This tissue hypoxia is reported as one of the early events in diabetes. Kumar et al. 2017 conducted a study involving 20 patients with diabetes (increased glucose level) subjected to 40 days of yoga, involving Savasana as one of the postures. The study revealed an increase in insulin levels with a decrease in blood glucose level</li>
        <li> Benefits of Savasana for Managing Depression: Tamilpulavendran and his colleague conducted research in hospitals at Puducherry to assess the effectiveness of Savasana on patients suffering from depression. Thirty patients were selected and assessed by answers in the questionnaire before and after performing Savasana or corpse pose for eight days. He concluded that there were remarkable changes in the stress levels of patients post practicing Savasana. This might be due to increase in endorphins by stretching and breathing which decreases physical exhaustion. 
        </li>
        <li> Benefits of Savasana in Managing Insomnia: Savasana or corpse pose may help in promoting quality and deep sleep. It is also called yogic Nidra – a form of deep yogic sleep. An individual suffering from difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or both can practice Savasana. It helps in calming the mind and body to provide better sleep at night which may decrease the doctor’s visits or intake of sleeping pills</li>
        <li>Benefits of Savasana for Relaxation: Savasana or corpse pose is the ultimate resting pose practiced after performing active asanas involved in opening the chest or airways, stretching muscles, and releasing tension. Remaining in the Savasana pose for more than 15 minutes everyday conditions the body to release stress </li>    
    </ol>

    <h3>How to do?</h3>
    <p>Savasana or corpse pose is a relaxing pose and is performed at the end of the yoga session. Therefore, any pose practiced before the corpse poses is the preparatory pose and consequently there is no counter pose to this asana. 
    </p>
    <p>Savasana or corpse pose can be achieved in the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sit on the floor, keeping your feet on the ground or floor and your knees bent. </li>
        <li>Lie back extending your legs with toes facing the ceiling.</li>
        <li>Keep your head in the center and do not allow it to fall on either side. 
        </li>
        <li>Extend your arms towards the bottom of the mat, resting the back of your hands on the floor. 
        </li>
        <li>Make sure to broaden your shoulders and ribs. 
        </li>
        <li>Relax your tongue, cheeks, lips, throat, and neck. 
        </li>
        <li>Let your eyes sink deep and slowly turn them downwards towards your heart. 
        </li>
        <li>Stay calm and rest in pose for about 5 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>Exit the pose by exhaling and slowly turning towards the side taking a deep breath. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Today’s world is moving at a rapid pace where multi-tasking and speed are seen as desirable qualities. Therefore, it has pressurized people to reboot themselves to improve functionality and productivity. Ultimately, this maximizes the burden and multiplies the stress. In such a situation, Savasana or the corpse pose is a big savior.  Hence, it should be practiced with or without performing other yoga asanas, to consciously relax and regulate breathing and promote stress reduction in lifestyle.
